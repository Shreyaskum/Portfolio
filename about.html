        <p>
          I am a graduate student at Santa Clara University currently pursuing
          masters in Computer Science Engineering. My past experience as a
          Software Engineer at WIPRO Ltd., has given me a solid understanding of
          architecting web-based and data-driven applications and services.
          Initially I was a part of Java Backend development team and later I
          moved to full stack python project. I was also a part of a networking
          team where I configured client devices using Software Defined
          Networking. Working with a team of 4 engineers, I was given complete
          ownership not just for implementing but also testing and deploying the
          service. My team followed the Agile model of development to deliver
          under tight deadlines. We also used GIT to deploy our projects in code
          cloud. In addition to this, I collaborated closely with the product
          team to decide the initial design requirements for the product and
          better understand the user experience. I feel that with my current
          skillset and broad exposure to technical frameworks, I can contribute
          to solving complex problems at scale.
